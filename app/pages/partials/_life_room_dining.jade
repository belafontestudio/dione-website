block description
  | When it comes to formal dining, guests can enjoy fine cuisine from the well-equipped galley in one of a number of locations, depending on the time of day, or the weather. The cosy dining room, for example, is fully enclosed, but to enjoy the great outdoors protected from the sun and wind, there is a large dining table under the bimini on the after deck. To dine completely ‘al fresco’ under the stars, there is another table on the open upper deck.
