block description
  | Of the six double cabins, one is on the main deck, off the dining room. It has an outside door giving straight out onto external walkway and ample windows that fill the cabin with light. The bathroom has a comfortable bathtub, with large showerhead above. When not used, this cabin can turn into a cozy sitting room, one wall fully covered by a pillared library in pale colored wood.
