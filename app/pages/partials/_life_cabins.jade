block description
  | Dione Star can accommodate 12 guests in 6 cabins: a combination of Italian design and simple refinement, happily recreates a mixture of the maritime feel of an old sailing boat together with the looks of a cozy childhood holiday home. The finishes vary between the cabins â€“ some are trimmed in mahogany, others in natural bamboo, and the rest in clarified oak, but all maintain the style of a true classic. There is also a large opening porthole, giving guests a fresh sea breeze and closer contact with their surroundings.
