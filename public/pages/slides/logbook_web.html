If you want some practical experience, you can take a turn at the wheel, learn about the navigation systems, or trim the sails, all under the friendly guidance of the Captain. After all, the term ‘sea change’ wasn’t invented by accident. As the yacht travels gently between the time zones with no risk of jet lag, you will find yourself relaxing to the rhythm of the ocean.</p></div></section></div><div id="slide9" class="slide"><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#" class="button active">Intro</a></li><li><a href="#" class="button">Caribbean</a></li><li><a href="#" class="button">Ocean Crossing</a></li><li><a href="#" class="button">Mediterranean</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Cruising Destinations</h1><p>Dione Star was conceived for sailing into the Pacific, and thus offers a striking amount of storage and living space on board, both in cabins and public spaces, that together with its 3000 miles of range, makes it particularly suitable to long periods away.
